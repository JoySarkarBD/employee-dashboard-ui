## Using json-server locally

This project includes a `db.json` with sample employee data and a script to run json-server alongside Vite.

Install deps:

```pwsh
npm install
```

Start both the mock API and the dev server:

```pwsh
npm run dev
```

The json-server will run at http://localhost:3000 and expose `/employees` endpoints used by the app.
